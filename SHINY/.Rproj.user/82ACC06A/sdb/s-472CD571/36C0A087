    "contents" : "Next Word Prediction - Capstone Project\n========================================================\nauthor:Bipika Amatya \ndate: 2016-04-12\n\nIntroduction\n========================================================\n\nThe objective of the App is implementing a predictive model that offers hints to one or more words, coherent to the sentence thatâ€™s been input by its user. The Capstone dataset used includes twitter, news and blogs from HC Corpora. After performing data cleansing, sampling and sub-setting, we gather all data in R data frames. Applying some Text Mining (TM) and NLP techniques, is created some set of word combinations (N-grams). These are the main support to Katz Backoff algorithm predicts the next word. Some adaptations and heuristics were specially developed to enhance this Shiny application.\n\nBuild Prediction Model\n========================================================\n\nThis project is to create a shiny App to predict next word based on previous input, using n-grams models, which are built in following steps:\n\n- Read millions lines content from news, blogs and tweets\n- Break each source into sentences\n- Removed special characters, numbers, punctuation and profanity\n- Built basic 4-gram model for predicting next word based on the previous 1, 2, or 3 words\n- Split off last word from each n-gram as Next-Word\n\n\nHow the app works\n========================================================\n\n- Go to the shinyapp [https://bipika.shinyapps.io/capstoneshiny/].\n- Type any word in the given textbox.\n- There is an existing text as well. \"Give it a\".\n- Above the textbox are the 3 predicted words.\n- Press \"Predict\" button to predict the next one.\n\nFurther Details:\n========================================================\n\n- ShinyApp (https://bipika.shinyapps.io/capstoneshiny/)\n- Github (https://github.com/krispyqueen/Capstone/tree/master/SHINY)\n",
