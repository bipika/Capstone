nlp-word-prediction
===================

Coursera / Johns Hopkins Data Science capstone project

This is a shiny app that predicts probable next words from two or three words
that are typed by the user.
The app uses a set of 4grams and frequencies processed from a big set of
 excerpts from Twitter, blogs, and news.

THis is a test of Jenkins.
